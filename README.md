# Jupyter service for jupyter
[XNAT](https://www.xnat.org) facilitates common management for imaging and associated data, including its analysis at the single-subject level. However, a service that aggregates all the individual data at the project level is missing. Here, we propose to add the [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) service as an application to aggregate all the individual data contained in a project by adding it as a container into the [docker-compose XNAT project](https://github.com/NrgXnat/xnat-docker-compose).
